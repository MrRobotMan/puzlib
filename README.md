# Puzlib
Puzlib is a collection of tools to help with solving of coding puzzles (Advent of Code, Everybody Codes, etc).

## Tools
- Reader: Reads a file contents into various forms. Most often used is `read_lines` to have the contents as a Vec<String>
- Math: Least common multiple (lcm) and greatest common divisor (gcd)
- Combinatorics: Permutations, Combinations, and Choose. All include a trait implemented on Vec<T>
- Search: Searching algorithms. Basic DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A*
- Measure: 2D and 3D vectors and operations on them.
